# Rush Hour Unreal Vehicle Toolkit

This Blender addon makes it a breeze to prepare vehicles for use in Unreal Engine. It's been designed with the [Rush Hour - Vehicle Animator](https://www.gdcorner.com/products/RushHour.html) plugin in mind, however it should be very useful for anyone who wants to get a car into Unreal, even without Rush Hour.

[Rush Hour is available for purchase on the Unreal Engine Marketplace here.](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/rush-hour-vehicle-animator)

[You can find out more about Rush Hour and documentation at the website here.](https://www.gdcorner.com/products/RushHour.html)
